alwaysApply: false

- a service should always live as part of a module, and be located at: `./src/modules/[name]/services/`
- a service file must be named: `[name].service.ts`
- never create a service as a function. always as a class.
- a service class always accepts `private readonly app: Application` as its first argument.
- a service can only be instantiated by its domain module main class, under which it lives.
